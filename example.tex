\abstract{A concise and factual abstract (written in third person and
  in one paragraph) of no more than 400 words is required. The
  abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the
  principal results and major conclusions. An abstract must be stand
  alone and complete in itself with no references to the main body of
  the manuscript. References should be avoided, but if essential, then
  cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon
  abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be
  defined at their first mention in the abstract itself. Readers
  should not have to read the full text to understand the
  abstract. The abstract can be an updated version of the one
  submitted at the call-for-abstracts, but its contents must not
  differ substantially.}

\maketitle

\section*{Nomenclature}
This section is not numbered. A nomenclature section could be provided
when there are mathematical symbols in your paper. Superscripts and
subscripts must be listed separately. Nomenclature definitions should
not appear again in the text.

\section*{Acronyms/Abbreviation}
This section is not numbered. Define acronyms and abbreviations that
are not standard in this section. Such acronyms and abbreviations that
are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention
there. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the
article. Always use the full title followed by the acronym
(abbreviation) to be used, e.g., reusable suborbital launch vehicle
(RSLV), International Space Station (ISS).


\section{Introduction}
Section headings are in bold and placed flush on the left hand margin
of the column.  The Introduction Section is to state the objectives of
the work, provide an adequate background including a brief literature
survey, major differences from the others, and sectional organization
of this paper. Avoid a too detailed and lengthy literature survey and
a summary of the results.  Divide your paper into clearly defined and
numbered sections numbered 1., 2., …. Subsections should be numbered
1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. Use this numbering also for
internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to “the text”. Any
subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on
its own separate line.

\subsection{Subsection headings}
Subsection headings are in italics and placed flush on the left hand
margin of the column.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection headings}
Sub-subsection headings are in italics and placed flush on the left
hand margin of the column.  Major headings are capitalized,
underlined, and centered in the column.

\section{Material and methods}
Provide sufficient detail to allow the work to be reproduced. Methods
already published should be indicated by a reference: only relevant
modifications should be described.

\section{Theory and calculation}
A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the
article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation
for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a
practical development from a theoretical basis.

\subsection{Equation numbers}
Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed
separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text). The
numbers identifying the equations should be placed in parentheses to
the right of the equation. For example \cite{newton1934sir}:

\begin{align}
  \vec{F}_{g} = - G \frac{m m_E}{R_E^2}\vec{i}_r = mg_{ta}
\end{align}


\subsection{Figure numbers}
Ensure that each figure/illustration has a title. All
figures/illustrations must be numbered and cited (see Fig. 1) in the
text consecutively. Place figures/ illustrations as close as possible
to the first references to them in the manuscript. Restrict them to
single-column width unless this would make them illegible (then extend
these figures/illustrations across two columns or place them to the
end of your paper).

\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{whiteknight.jpg}
  \caption{\label{fig:X}SpaceShipTwo carried under White Knight Two}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Tables}
Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article,
or on separate page(s) at the end. Number and cite (as shown in Table
1) tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the
text. Place table title above and any remarks below the table body.


\begin{table}
  \caption{\label{table:X}Major data of the orbits of Venus, Earth,
    Mars and Jupiter}
  \begin{tabular}{rllll}
    \toprule
    & Venus & Earth & Mars & Jupiter \\
    \midrule
    $\rfrac{M}{M_E}$	& 0.82 		& 1 		& 0.11 		& 317.89	\\
    $e$					& 0.007		& 0.017		& 0.093		& 0.048		\\
    $R$ (AU)			& 0.7233	& 1			& 1.524		& 5.203		\\
    $i$ (deg)			& 3.40		& 0			& 1.85		& 1.30		\\
    $T$ (years)			& 0.62		& 1			& 1.88		& 11.86		\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Tables with a moderate amount of information should be positioned
within one column. Tables, figures or pictures with large amounts of
information or size may extend across two columns.

\subsection{Page Numbers}
Indicate page number at the bottom of each page.

\section{Results}
Results should be clear and concise.

\section{Discussion}
This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not
repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often
appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published
literature.

\section{Conclusions}
The main conclusions of the study may be presented in a short
Conclusions section, which may stand alone or form a subsection of a
Discussion or Results and Discussion section.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
This section is not numbered.

\section*{Appendix A: Citations In Text}
Indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with the
text. The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference
number(s) must always be given.  Example: “..... as demonstrated
\cite{von1975history,hunley1999history}.  \cite{neufeld1990weimar}
obtained a different result ....”

\section*{Appendix B: Disclaimer}
To the best of my knowledge, there is no official IAC 2017 \LaTeX{}
template.  This template is based on previous work.  It complies
roughly with the .DOC template released by the IAF, but there are no
guarantees as to whether or not it will produce documents acceptable
for submission. Use at your own risk.

Copyright statement is not included in template, based on the explicit
instructions not to do so in the ``Instructions To Authors'' document.
